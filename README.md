# OpenOrienteering Superbuild vcpkg-ports

This repository contains vcpkg ports for building OpenOrienteering software.
It is meant to be used as a vcpkg registry.
It contains ports which provide utilities for building ports from,
and actual ports based on, Debian source packages.

It is intended to eventually support Linux, Android, macOS and MinGW for Windows.
Supporting MSVC for Windows might be added, however MSVC is assumed to be
sufficiently covered by the default VCPKG registry.
