 Being generated and distribued by the Debian project, these file can be
 assumed to be DFSG-free in a Debian sense. Each .dsc files is generated
 during the build of a Debian source package and available from Debian
 servers. It lists maintainers and uploaders for this package in Debian.
 Unless explicitly stated, these persons are not involved in the vcpkg port.
 Most content in a .dsc file is derived from the debian/control file which
 is part of the package's .debian tarball. This tarball also holds a
 debian/copyright file.
